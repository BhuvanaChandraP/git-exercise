It is natural for students to wonder how they will benefit from the study of programming language concepts.
After all, many other topics in computer science 
are worthy of serious study. The following is what we believe to be a compelling 
list of potential benefits of studying concepts of programming languages:
xyz................
people can think is influenced by the expressive power of the language in 
which they communicate their thoughts. Those with only a weak understanding of natural 
language are limited in the complexity of their thoughts, 
particularly in depth of abstraction. In other words, it is difficult for people 
to conceptualize structures they cannot describe, verbally or in writing.
Programmers, in the process of developing software, are similarly constrained.
The language in which they develop software places limits on 
the kinds of control structures, data structures, and abstractions they can 
use; thus, the forms of algorithms they can construct are likewise limited. 
Awareness of a wider variety of programming language features can reduce 
such limitations in software development. Programmers can increase the 
range of their software development thought processes by learning new 
language constructs.
